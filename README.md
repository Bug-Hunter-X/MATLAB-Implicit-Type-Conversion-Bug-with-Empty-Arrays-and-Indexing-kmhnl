# MATLAB Implicit Type Conversion Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion and logical indexing when dealing with functions returning empty arrays.  The bug arises when trying to access elements of an empty array returned by a function, resulting in a subscript index error.

The `bug.m` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides a solution to avoid this unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The core issue stems from the implicit type handling within MATLAB when a function returns an empty array. Subsequent attempts to use standard array indexing on this empty array may result in errors, despite the absence of any syntax errors in the code itself.

## Solution

The solution involves adding explicit checks to handle the scenario of an empty array being returned. This prevents implicit type conversion issues that could lead to errors during indexing operations.
